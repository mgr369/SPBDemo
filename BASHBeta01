    <span title>Introduction to bash Scripting</span>
    <pre zoom labels = "bash, dev_lang.bash">
        <span xsmall>#!/bin/bash</span>
        Linux does not have extensions. If we want to create a script in Bash, it is imperative to add 
        in the first line of a file "#!/bin/bash".
       

    </pre>
    <span title>Variables</span>
    <pre zoom labels = "bash, dev_lang.bash">
        <span xsmall>variable=5</span>

       It is important, when you are using variables, not to put spaces between "=". 
       The int 5 has been assgined to the new variable called "variable". 

    </pre>
    <span title>Passing Arguments to the Script</span>
    <pre zoom labels = "bash, dev_lang.bash">
        <span xsmall>./script a1 a2 a3...</span>
        When executing a script it is possible to add arguments, for instance numbers, strings...
        They are saved in variables:
            $0 --> programme's name.
            $1 --> a1
            $2 --> a2 
            $3 --> a3

        $# --> provides the number of arguments introduced.

    </pre>

    <span title>Console Input/Output</span>
    <pre zoom labels = "bash, dev_lang.bash">
        <span xsmall>read and echo</span>
        Input: using read allows to introduce information by keyboard, saving it into a variable.
            read variable. 
        
            It is possible: read number1,number2,number3

        Output: using echo allows to print a given information in console.
            echo "THIS IS AN EXAMPLE"
       
    </pre>

    <span title>I/O Redirection</span>
    <pre zoom labels = "bash, dev_lang.bash">
        <span xsmall>We can change default console I/O</span>

            By default the standard output is connected to the screen, the standard input to the
            keyboard, and the standard error to the screen.

            These destinations can be reassigned before running the program, known as I/O redirection.

            For example: $ ls /etc/*.txt > List.txt 
                We have redirect ls output into a file called List.txt

            Another example:    $ grep word < List.txt
                In this example, there is an input redirection (List.txt is given to grep).
                
        
    </pre>

    <span title>Show the information of a file</span>
    <pre zoom labels = "bash, dev_lang.bash">
        <span xsmall>less, cat and more</span>
        If you want to display the content of the /etc/passwd file you can run:

             $ less /etc/passwd       

    </pre>

    <span title>Filter the command output</span>
    <pre zoom labels = "bash, dev_lang.bash">
        <span xsmall>grep, head, tail, cut and sort</span>
            
        grep: shows the lines that meet a certain condition.
        $ less /etc/passwd | grep root (see lines from the /etc/passwd file that contain the
        root word)

        Shows the first n lines (head) or the last n lines (tail).

        $ head -n [num_lines]
        $ tail -n [num_lines]

        $ less /etc/passwd | head -n 5 
        $ less /etc/passwd | tail -n 5

        Displays a certain column (cut).

        $ cut –d "delimiter" -f[rows]
        $ less /etc/passwd | cut -d ":" -f1

        Also, you can sort the output using the (sort) command.
            (-n shows that it is sorting numbers)
        $ less /etc/passwd | cut -d ":" -f3 | sort -n

    <span title>Logical and Arithmetic operations</span>
    <pre zoom labels = "bash, dev_lang.bash">
        <span xsmall>Working with variables</span>
        To do operations, use the expr command and to perform comparisons,
        use the test command.

    <span title>expr command</span>
    <pre zoom labels = "bash, dev_lang.bash">
        <span xsmall>It is used to  do arithmetic operations and to manipulate strings</span>
        To do operations, use the expr command and to perform comparisons,
        use the test command.   

        $ expr arg1 op arg2 [op arg3...]

        where op means operator. 

        #!/bin/bash
        echo -n "Type a number: "
        read var1
        echo -n "Type another number: "

    <span title>Operators</span>
    <pre zoom labels = "bash, dev_lang.bash, operation">
        <span xsmall>A brief list of operators</span>
        
        Arithmetic operators:
        + Addition .
        - Subtraction .
        \* Multiplication.
        / Division.
        % Modulus.

        Relational operators:

        = Its returns true is they are equal otherwise returns false.
        != Return true if the two operands are not equal otherwise it returns false.
        > Return true if the first operand is greater than the second operand otherwise return false.
        >= Returns true if first operand is greater than or equal to second operand otherwise returns false.
        < Returns true if first operand is less than second operand otherwise returns false.
        <= Returns true if first operand is less than or equal to second operand otherwise returns false.

        Logic operators:
        | Logic OR.
        & Logic AND.

    <span title>test command</span>
    <pre zoom labels = "bash, dev_lang.bash">
        <span xsmall>Evaluates three types of elements: files, strings, and numbers</span>
        This command can be executed in two different ways.
           1. test -option file
           2. [expresion]

           Options that allows you to use the command test according to a data type:
        
           Files or directories:
           -f Returns true if el the file exists and it is a regular file.
           -s Returns true if el the file exists and if its size is greater than 0.
           -r Returns true if el the file exists and has read permissions.
           -w Returns true if el the file exists and has write permissions.
           -x Returns true if el the file exists and has execution permissions.
           -d Returns true if el the file exists and it is a directory.

           Numeric values:
           -lt Less than
           -le Less or equal than
           -gt Greater than
           -ge Greater or equal than
           -eq Equal
           -ne Not equal

           Conectors:
           -o OR
           -a AND
           ! NOT


           Some examples:

                test -f /etc/passwd
                [string1 = string2]
                test 20 –lt 40
