    <span xsmall>Breadth-First, Depth-First and Depth-First Search with Iterative Deeping</span>
    Brute-force Search is a general problem-solving technique. It consists of systematically enumerating all possible candidates for the solution. 
    The algorithm checks if this cadidate satisfies problem's requirement.
    
    --> Breadth-First (BFS): Explores the search tree from top to bottom level by level using a queue (FIFO).
    
    --> Depth-First (DFS): Explores the search tree branch by branch from top to bottom using a stack (LIFO).
    
    --> Depth-First with Iterative Deeping:  Using a finite tree in order to avoid DFS' infinite loops.

    The minimax algorithm uses DFS until a preset limit exploring the search tree. 
    The evaluation of an inner state is obtained by maximizing or minimizing, depending on the state level, 
    the evaluation values ​​of its successor states.

    Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function.
    It is used in problems where finding an approximate global optimum is more important than finding a precise local optimum in 
    a fixed amount of time.
